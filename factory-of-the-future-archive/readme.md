# archiver notes
for some reason, on the 2nd of april at 9:00am, the 'Factory of the Future' section of swinburne's website changed. 
it has all this ominous stuff about like... animatronic parts and enhancements in it? and it got taken down about a second later.
i have a scraper on swinburne's website to check for this stuff (it was a test project for something similar i'm doing in my capstone), but i couldn't find who made the changes or why... i'm guessing it was an automated update, judging by the upload timing, but what kind of automated update would upload something like this??? plus it seemed to break a lot of the functionality of the page: a lot of the galleries and stuff are broken, you can't even see what they say without looking through the code. maybe that's why they took it back down, i dunno
i haven't had time to look over it in detail, so i've uploaded it to my personal page here in case anyone finds anything else of note in it. i'd recommend archiving it yourself: who knows how long they'll let me keep it up
but hey, now i can call myself an official archivist! archiver? whatever. maybe i can put this on my resume lol
